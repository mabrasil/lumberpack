## What's inside?

Well, a modern lumberjack has many modern needings and it is only fair that (s)he uses some of the coolest
technologies we have today, so this boilerplate includes:

### Livescript

[LiveScript](http://livescript.net/) is a JavaScript preprocessor which has a pretty *beautiful syntax* and
supports functional programming with lovable features like *currying*, *function composition*, *pattern matching* and
many other ones borrowed from languages like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

### Jade

The  [Jade Engine](http://jade-lang.com/)  is one of the most powerful template engines we have nowadays and its use is intended to make the app templates' code more beautiful and **easier to maintain**. It also aims to solve some problems such as missing or mal-matched closing tags.

### Stylus

#### Stylint

Personally, I do think that one of the points considered as favorable to Stylus may not be that good: a more permissive syntax. But we can use a [linter](https://github.com/rossPatton/stylint) to make things more strict and enjoy the benefits of a *full JS-based stack*.

#### Skeleton

[Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) which is an amazingly simple and responsive boilerplate for Mobile-Friendly
development.
